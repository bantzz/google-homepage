   # google-homepage
    Here lies my first attempt at coding anything in my life.  
    I spent an estimated 15 hours on this project. Utilising my 
    conscious and sub-conscious mind (and Google) to the best of 
    their ability. I learned a lot, it isn't close to perfect upon 
    my initial commit, but I daresay a lay person would see
    the finished product and acknowledge that it is an attempt to 
    replicate the google-homepage.
